# capstone_react_springBoot_fullStack
A full-stack application for building an aircraft in two-dimensional views. User can drag their aircraft components to their desired positions and save their progress onto the database.
Built with React, HTML, CSS, SpringBoot, Spring Security, MariaDB, Java

The end goal for this project is to visualize the aircraftâ€™s geomancy and flying performance. By allowing the users to locate and resizing the aircraft components. The data will sent back to the database and return back the calculated performance.
But so far the current version of the application only have the ability to build and store data. It still do not have the ability to calculate the performance
